# Covid-Fighters
*This is the First repository of the QuarantineDev Group built during the Italian Quarantine from COVID-19. The goal is to develop something (EDIT: a telegram bot) just using some vocal client to assign the jobs, avoiding any possible contact.*

### Motivations and theme:
Since we were forced to stay home, we decided to take a well known game, called *Resistence* and develop a **Telegram bot** out of it. We decided to settle the game to March 2020, during the COVID19 pandemy.
### How to start up the bot:
In the main directory, create a file named **token.js** and type inside:
```bash
exports.token = "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```
### Commands
# [TBD]
